# We build the docker (put in correct image name)
docker build -f gcp_train.dockerfile . -t title-generation:latest

# Build our GCP docker locally first:
docker ps -a
docker rm 

# Docker run without arguments for the first gcp docker image
docker run --name train_model title-generation:latest  

# Push the docker to GCP
docker tag title-generation gcr.io/title-generation/title-generation
docker push gcr.io/title-generation/title-generation

# We try with a run by submitting the image we have pushed to GCP
gcloud ai-platform jobs submit training title-generation-test --region europe-west4 --master-image-uri <copy-docker-path>

# We monitor the run by (also shows the args the run is being run with):
gcloud ai-platform jobs describe title-generation-test

# Right now we are also copying data into the container which is not good practice this should also be loaded from the bucket
